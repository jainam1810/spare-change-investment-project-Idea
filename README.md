# 💸 Smart Spare Change Investment Feature (Revolut-Style)

## 🚀 Overview

This mini project demonstrates my Product Owner skills through designing a **Smart Spare Change Investment** feature for a digital banking app, inspired by products like **Revolut**.  

The idea is to help users passively grow wealth by automatically rounding up everyday card transactions to the nearest whole currency unit and investing the spare change into simple, user-chosen assets like ETFs, crypto, or gold.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Young professionals and first-time investors often want to invest but struggle with saving significant amounts or managing complex products. By making small, automatic micro-investments through spare change, they can build good financial habits and grow wealth effortlessly.

## 🎯 Target User Persona

**Name:** Jainam
**Age:** 21
**Profile:** Early career, first job  
**Goal:** Wants to start investing but doesn’t have time or large savings  
**Pain Point:** Feels investing is complicated and risky for small amounts

## ✅ Solution

- **Automatic Round-Ups:** Each card payment rounds up to the nearest whole number.
- **Invest Spare Change:** Spare change is collected and invested once it reaches a minimum threshold
- **Simple Control:** Users can toggle the feature ON/OFF anytime and choose where their change goes.

## 🗂️ MVP Scope

1. **Round-Up Toggle:** Users can enable/disable the round-up feature.
2. **Investment Selection:** Users choose between a few preset investment options.
