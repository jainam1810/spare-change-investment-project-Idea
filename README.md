# 💸 Smart Spare Change Investment Feature (Revolut-Style)

## 🚀 Overview

This mini project demonstrates my **Product Owner** skills by designing a **Smart Spare Change Investment** feature for a digital banking app, inspired by products like **Revolut**.

The goal is to help users passively grow wealth by automatically rounding up everyday card transactions to the nearest whole currency unit and investing the spare change into simple, user-chosen assets like ETFs, crypto, or gold.
